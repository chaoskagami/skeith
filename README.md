Skeith
--------

This is a repo that is attached to a cron job on my system and automatically compiles nightlies of corbenik.

Rather than waste time hosting on a dedicated server, I'm just (ab)using github infrastructure.

This is updated every ~30ish minutes while my computer is running if there are new commits. My computer is near always up, so that's not anything to worry about. If it isn't up, chances are there's no new commits regardless.
