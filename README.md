Skeith
--------

This is a repo that is attached to a cron job on my system and automatically compiles Corbenik on new commits. These builds come with an alternate name and prefix, so they can safely coexist with stable releases.

Rather than waste time hosting on a dedicated server, I'm just (ab)using github infrastructure here.

This is updated every ~30ish minutes while my computer is running if there are new commits. My computer is near always up, so that's not anything to worry about. If it isn't up, chances are there's no new commits regardless.
